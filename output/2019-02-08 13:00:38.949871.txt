Best Motion Picutre - Comedy or Musical:  Les Misrables  #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes best comedy/musical nominee 'Les Mis' - wonderful production value, a musical on an epic scale - but the story has real holes
I hope Les Mis wins for best comedy! #GoldenGlobes
Les Miserables!!! such a great movie/musical!!! #GoldenGlobes
It's weird that they put comedy and musical in the same category (best motion picture), considering Les Mis is nominated... #GoldenGlobes
It's a shame that Comedy and Musical is combined at the Golden Globes. Impossible to compare.
A nominee for #BestMotionPicture for A Comedy and Musical for Tonight's 70th #GoldenGlobes is #LesMiserables, Jake's prediction to win!
Let's hope the Hollywood Foreign Press made the right choice: Les Mis for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy #GoldenGlobes
Lumping Comedy and Musical in the same category is like putting dryer sheets in the fish aisle at the supermarket. #GoldenGlobes

Something odd about the Golden Globes: lumping Musical and Comedy in same category. About 90% of Les Mis is the antithesis of comedy.

I really like watching the Golden Globes.  Drunk celebrities, pretty dresses, movie + tv people. #goldenglobes
#GoldenGlobes Brave kicked ass, also #Pixar made a movie that is not Cars aka they obviously won
2013 Golden Globes: Jimmy Fallon: Comedian Jimmy Fallon jokes about TV and movie stars coming together under one... http://t.co/8QaNkRUh
Tonight has made me realize I watch WAY too many movies and WAY too much tv but w.evss #goldenglobes
Delayed flight into NYC but flying @JetBlue made my night! #glutenfree  popcorn AND #GoldenGlobes live on TV #win http://t.co/tmuioXVQ
#GoldenGlobes Why is an HBO movie in the same category as TV comedies? WEIRD!
RT @jadorecafe: Tina Fey made the best diss of the year!  "Taylor stay away from Micheal J. Fox's son"  #goldenglobes
Tina Fey just made the best Taylor Swift joke!! Too good. #goldenglobes #tinafey
That montage made me realize that I have never liked a Jodie Foster movie. #goldenglobes
RT @SimoneSOliver: Things to do this summer: watch every movie Jodi Foster has ever made. #goldenglobes
RT @cyclechickcathy: @WizardOfOsrin LOL! I love watching the movie actors be all serious and the TV actors get all wasted! #GoldenGlobes
Finally made it home to watch the #goldenglobes on the actual TV. #happygirl
Jodie Foster just made the #GoldenGlobes sappy, despite RDJs best efforts.
Jodie Foster's speech just got nominated for best Mini-series for next year's awards... #GoldenGlobes
According to my twitter feed, Jodie Foster just made the best AND the worst speech ever at the #GoldenGlobes. That takes skill.
SNL at the globes made it the best #goldenglobes
I would like the Closed Captioner for this year's #GoldenGlobes to CC every TV show and movie I ever watch with CC on. Excellent work!
RT @evachen212: watching Golden Globes with my father and he's made the same joke 10 times about Argo the movie being about Argo Tea. (dad humor, eye roll)
It's a really long walk from TV Land thru Movie land to that stage lol #GoldenGlobes
I think we can all agree Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting the Golden Globes was the best decision anyone has ever made
Hmmmm.  Apparently the Golden Globes are on tonight... living without a TV has made me so uninformed!
RT @Instagramwords: Picture of The Golden Globes on my TV.
How does a movie that has been made 40 times before, win best picture. Was it that much better on the fortieth time #goldenglobes
Does everyone who made a movie or TV show get a trophy?  #goldenglobes

RT @goldenglobes: Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television - Game Change - #GoldenGlobes
The nominees are Daniel Day Lewis and...some other dudes who made a movie the same year as DDL.  #GoldenGlobes
So glad Daniel Day Lewis won. He made that movie! #GoldenGlobes
And then Julia Roberts walked out and made us forget any other movie star existed. Ever. #GoldenGlobes
RT @atitop: RT @Instagramwords: Picture of The Golden Globes on my TV.
Julia Roberts presented Argo with the best picture. That made my night. BECAUSE WHERE IS TINA? #GoldenGlobes
Django is chained again. It should have won for Greatest Picture Ever Made, replacing Highlander. #GoldenGlobes
It's nice to see actual movie stars and not reality tv celebrity trash #GoldenGlobes
The SNL group MADE these #GoldenGlobes tonight! #TinaFey #AmyPoehler #KristenWiig #WillFerrell Best year for this show in a loooong time.
Congrats to old Ben Affleck. He made a damn good little movie and got him a @goldenglobes award. #ThisWasntGigli #ArgoFuckYourself
The TV production for the Golden Globes made me uncomfortable.
Glad "Argo" won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. Tonight only made the Academy Awards snubbing of Ben Affleck more glaring. #GoldenGlobes
SNL alumni made this year's Golden Globes the best award show I've seen in a while. Them and Jodie Foster. #goldenglobes
Best #GoldenGlobes analysis goes to @YeoMichie honorable mention to @katemorawetz nice work, you guys made me laugh.
And that's a wrap folks! Who made it on your best and worst dressed lists? Read it all on @iVillageCanada #GoldenGlobes

Sorry for the non-stop tweeting about the #GoldenGlobes...but movie and tv are my passion.  G'night Twitter...can't wait to watch @girlsHBO.
Ben Affleck made my night! Congrats, my luv. You deserve all the best! #ARGO #GoldenGlobes
That has to be the best #GoldenGlobes I've ever seen. Made me want to write tomorrow and work harder.

@vulture: Game Change wins Best Miniseries. Congrats to Sarah Palin on 2 more minutes of attention. #goldenglobes
As the movie and tv industries celebrate tonights Golden Globes, I think it is important to note that I sometimes watch movies and tv.
